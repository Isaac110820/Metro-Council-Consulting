# Metro-Council-Consulting

### Problem Description:

##### Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County has two questions regarding interactions between Nashville citizens and the police. 

##### Part 1: 
Metro council wants to better understand the relationship between adverse events and levels of dissatisfaction with police.  They want to know if citizens are more dissatisfied with the police in areas where police calls are more frequent. 

##### Part 2: 
Metro council wants to know if there are certain days of the week where traffic violations are more likely to end in a warning as opposed to a citation.
