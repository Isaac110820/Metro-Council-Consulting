# Metro-Council-Consulting

### Problem Description and Results:

#### Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County has two questions regarding interactions between Nashville citizens and the police. 

#### Part 1: 
Metro council wants to better understand the relationship between adverse events and levels of dissatisfaction with police.  They want to know if citizens are more dissatisfied with the police in areas where police calls are more frequent. 

#### Part 1 - Results: 
For some police calls, as the frequency of calls increases, the level of dissatisfaction with the police also increases. These calls include:
- Missing Person
- Disorderly Person
- Person with Weapon

However, for some calls, as the frequency of calls increases, there is little to no change in the level of dissatisfaction with the police.  These calls include: 
- Community Policing Activity
- Business Check
- Intoxicated Person

#### Part 2: 
Metro council wants to know if there are certain days of the week where traffic violations are more likely to end in a warning as opposed to a citation. 

#### Part 2 Results: 
When looking at traffic violations that end in either a warning or a citation, there is a higher chance of receiving a warning on a weekend compared to a weekday.  

On average, there is an 82.98% chance of receiving a warning on a weekday and an 87.61% chance of receiving a warning on a weekend
